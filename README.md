# Image recognition with CNNs
A few notebooks on building image classifiers with CNNs.
Part 1: How to build a binomial classifier from scratch based on the images of two classes, cats and dogs
Part 2: How to build a binomial classifier but using a pretrained convnet (VGG16) instead
Part 3: How to build a multilabel image classifier with 10 classes using the CIFAR-10 database
Part 4: (coming up soon: using the pretrained ResNet50 convnet for classifying any image)
